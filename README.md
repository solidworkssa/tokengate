Token-gated access control for digital content

## Overview

TokenGate is a decentralized application built on both Base (Ethereum L2) and Stacks (Bitcoin L2). It leverages the security of both chains to provide a robust and trustless experience.

## Features

- Dual-chain smart contract architecture (Solidity + Clarity)
- Modern Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- Wallet integration for MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Leather, and Xverse
- Foundry test suite for Solidity contracts
- Clarinet integration for Clarity development

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

## Contracts

### Base (Solidity)

```bash
cd contracts/base
forge build          # Compile
forge test -vvv      # Run tests
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url $RPC_URL  # Deploy
```

### Stacks (Clarity)

```bash
cd contracts/stacks
clarinet check       # Validate
clarinet test        # Run tests
clarinet console     # Interactive REPL
```
