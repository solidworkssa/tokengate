## Security Considerations

- All smart contracts should be audited before mainnet deployment
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Never commit private keys, mnemonics, or API secrets
- Review all dependency updates for known vulnerabilities
- Follow the principle of least privilege in contract design

## Scope

This policy covers:
- Smart contracts in `contracts/`
- Frontend application in `apps/web/`
- Shared packages in `packages/`
